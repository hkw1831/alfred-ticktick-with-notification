# Alfred 4 TickTick Integration

This Alfred workflow will add tasks to [TickTick](https://ticktick.com/) via REST API.

After running this workflow will receive a notification to indicate task is added or error occurred.

This workflow is a modified version of [this repository](https://github.com/cmer/alfred-ticktick).

## Usage:

`tt <your task name>`

After that ticktick will create a task prefixed with today in yyyyMMdd format to TickTick.
